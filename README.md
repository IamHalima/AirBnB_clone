# AirBnB_clone
This is the first step towards building a full web application: Writing a command interpreter to manage the ALX-Holberton [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/) clone objects.

Please note that not all features on the original Airbnb site are implemented. However the features that are implemented will be listed below.

## Features

### Command Interpreter

#### Description

The Command Interpreter is used to manage the whole application's functionality from the command line, such as:
+ Crete a new object.
+ Retrieve an object from a file, database, etc.
+ Execute operation on objects. e.g. Count, compute statistics, etc.
+ Update an object's attributes.
+ Destroy an object.
